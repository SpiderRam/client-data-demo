# client-data-demo

* Demo page created for application process at Paymerang.

* Dummy data was provided in json file.

* The requirement - create a webpage that shows each Payee/Payment/Remittance object in a paged interface.  I have never created a website with pagination before, and this was a fun challenge in that regard.

* I took my styling cues from the Paymerang website.

* I used Vue.js for the ease of rendering data with its v-for functionality, and toggling visibility with v-if.  I have only learned the basics of Vue, hence my use of the cdn instead of the full router, with component syntax.

* For a cleaner UX/UI, I chose to add nav tabs for rendering the Payee/Payment/Remittance data separately.
